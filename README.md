# Banking

This project is the part of my certification and involve live data. In this project, I used the past data with customers characteristics to predict if a bank customer will subscribe to the new term deposit plan or not. I used the logistic regression to solve this problem.  

Attach are the reproducible codes and the data.  


Happy learning :)
